Main Program
1. Input tags that you are interested in
2. Get posts related to the tags that you entered
3. Filter tags based on what shows up the most common
4. Filter posts based on filtered tags
5. Get a list of posts that will be reblogged
6. Reblog all posts that are still left from the list of posts.

Extra Work
1. Create a timer that allows the user to automatically repost every X time.
2. Create a smart filter that actively attempts to bundle together related tags
3. Create a smart filter that actively filters posts based on related tags
4. Create a smart comment bot that reblogs items with comments generated by our program
5. Modify the timer that randomizes when it posts based on mu and sigma (bot detection avoidance)
